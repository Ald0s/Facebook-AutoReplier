# Facebook AutoReplier
A comical and very annoying desktop application that will automatically reply to Facebook private messages in a manner you'd like. The solution uses Selenium 3.5.2 and ChromeDriver 2.29, both of which you'll need in order to compile this for yourself. The application will, when fully developed, offer the following services:
* Reverse all messages sent to you and send them back
* Reply with a randomised insult
* Play hangman with a user messaging you.

### Getting Started
Simply compile the solution with Visual Studio (or your choice of compiler.) The solution uses Google Chrome to perform its automated tasks, but can be converted to Firefox quite easily, just by modifying all instances of ChromeDriver and ensuring you have FirefoxDriver.

### Prerequisites
* .NET Framework (4.0)
* Selenium 3.5.2
* ChromeDriver 2.29 (https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.29/)
